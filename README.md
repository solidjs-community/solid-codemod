# Solid Codemod

This repository is created to store codemod scripts for use with
[JSCodeshift][jscodeshift] that help update [SolidJS][solidjs] APIs.

We're currently looking for transformations which SolidJS community
is interested in. Please create a [feature request][feature-request] or
upvote/comment on [existing feature requests][feature-request-existing]
which have the input and output code of the transformation you are looking for.

For example, here is a feature request to [transform useState/useEffect of ReactJS to createSignal/onCleanup of SolidJS][feature-request-example]
for your reference.
